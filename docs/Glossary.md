# Incident Response Glossary of Terms

Common terms you might encounter when you are discussing shutdowns or increased blocking. Some of these terms may be used differently within various groups/organizations or by different people. This is a reference point for ease of communication and not to correct or critique. *WIP*

### This is a community driven work, while we have started with a glossary in English, the hope is to have other languages represented in the future.


* Connection  
  * Vpns \- proxy point for internet access  
  * Length of time matters: 1 minutes, min 60 sec \+, adversary is known to block uncategorizable connections that are sustained (30 seconds and 60 seconds),  
  * Nto based on time but rather whether a transmission of data happened  
  * Should be based on both  
  * Sub categories should be considered: sustained connection? stable connection? successful connection?   
  * Connectivity (sustained or stable connections), connections has been made and no has connectivity  
* User  
  * Person that is interacting with the tool (end user)  
  * One connection that is shared with others can be counted as one user but is not only one person  
  * Potential users vs active users  
  * Non-users: unique IPs (could be a proxy) how do account for CGNat?  
* Stack  
  *   
* Packet  
  * TCP/IP definition, smallest unit of transmission  
  * But…you can put a packet in a packet  
* DPI  
* Message (what the packets make)  
* VPN \- technical definition versus common understanding  
* Trust \- Digital trust, encryption keys, vs state actors owning the keys  
* Blocking  
* Shutdown  
  * Partial  
  * What level or thing is blocked, IP, social website  
  * \#KeepItOnCoalition’s [definition](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton-data-methodology/#faq): "An internet shutdown is an intentional disruption of internet or electronic communications, rendering them inaccessible or effectively unusable, for a specific population or within a location, often to exert control over the flow of information."
* Censorship  
* Active e.g active user  
* User acquisition  
* Incident  
* Offline  
* P2P \- Peer to Peer, point to point  
* Mesh, mesh network  
* Node  
* Centralization and decentralization  
* Splinternet  
* Isolation  
* Encryption  
* Obfuscation  
* Circumvention, circumvention tool  
* Bandwidth  
* TCP/IP OSI  
* Wireless  
* Filtering  
* Mirror  
* Cache  
* Logs/logging  
* Report  
* Surveillance
