# IncidentResponse

This is the documentation repo for the Incident Response Working Group. The working group meets periodically in order to help build community collaboration while addressing issues of internet shutdown incidents.

Currently we are working on a glossary of [shared terms](https://github.com/OperatorFoundation/IncidentResponse/blob/main/docs/Glossary.md).
