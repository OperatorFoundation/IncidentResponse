# IncidentResponse Glossary of Terms

Common terms you might encounter when you are discussing shutdowns or increased blocking. Some of these terms may be used differently within various groups/organizations or by different people. This is a reference point for ease of communication and not to correct or critique. *WIP*

### This is a community driven work, while we have started with a glossary in English, the hope is to have other languages represented in the future
